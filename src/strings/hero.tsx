            I{"'"}m a London-based engineer with a serious passion for creating{" "}
            <span style={{ color: "#ffb400" }}>intuitive, dynamic applications</span> with complex functionality and
            clean, maintainable software.
            <div style={{ marginTop: 14 }} />
            Fueled by high energy levels and <span style={{ color: "#ffb400" }}>boundless enthusiasm</span>, I{"'"}m
            easily inspired to follow my fascinations wherever they take me. As an expressive, multi-talented spirit
            with a natural ability to entertain and inspire, Iâ€™m never satisfied just thinking of new ideas. Instead, I
            have an <span style={{ color: "#ffb400" }}>impulsive need</span> to act upon them.
            <div style={{ marginTop: 14 }} />I{"'"}m a fast learner, able to pick up new skills and juggle different
            projects and roles with relative ease. I love remote-working for agencies, consulting for startups, and
            collaborating with <span style={{ color: "#ffb400" }}>talented mindsets</span> to create digital products
            for both business and consumer use.
            <div style={{ marginTop: 14 }} />
            My <span style={{ color: "#ffb400" }}>abundant energy</span> fuels me in the pursuit of many interests,
            hobbies, areas of study and artistic endeavors. Outside of my screen time I{"'"}m a student pilot, an
            astronomer, a tennis fanatic, a competitive swimmer, a lifeguard and a pretty good chef.
